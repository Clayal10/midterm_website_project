					<h2>Our Great Team</h2>
					<p>
						Our current team could be the best men's team our program has ever had. The NAIA has gotten better and better every year, so we are in for a challenge. Luckily for us, our team consists of almost entirely the same members from the last few years.<br><br>Our team is one of, if not the, best teams in the school.
					</p>
					<h2>Our Legacy</h2>
					<p>
						The Lewis-Clark State College cross country team has a very rich history. We have had many podium and near podium teams, as well as twenty plus years of qualifying for the national meet. Our highest placing has been third for the men and second for the women. Dr. Michael Collins has been coaching for 28 years, the entirety of the programs existence.<br><br>Our team has also had incredible individual athletes. We have yet to have an individual national champion in cross country, but we've had many national champions on the track. Some of which include Sam Atkin in the 5k and 3k (multiple times), Clayton Vandyke in the 800, and current athlete Carter Gordon in the 800. Sam Atkin is currently competing as one of the greatest runners in the world. He is a two time olympian and has ran the 67th fastest 5000 meter time in history.
