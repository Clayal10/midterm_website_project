					<h2 class="meet_name">Clash of the Inland Northwest</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>3rd, 103 points:</strong><br>This meet was a great start to the season. This race went a little faster than it has in previous years, and our men went even faster. This was also only a 6 kilometer race.
					</p>
					<h2 class="meet_name">Courger Classic</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>10th, 211 points:</strong><br>This meet was another chance for our men to show off. We had some fast times for an 8 kilometer race and we faced lots of big teams in the NCAA D1 West region.
					</p>
					<h2 class="meet_name">Gans Creek Invitational</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>9th, 219 points:</strong><br>This was a defining meet for our men. We raced against the best teams in the NAIA in the midwest and did great. Some men were sick and others stepped up. We were ranked 9th in the nation after this meet.
					</p>
					<h2 class="meet_name">Willamette Invitational</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>19th, 536 points:</strong><br>This was a partial squad, the runners who did not race in Missouri. Solid racing for our 11th-16th men on the team.
					</p>
					<h2 class="meet_name">LC Invite</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>5th, 108 points:</strong><br>A decent showing for the LC men, and an great showing for the women. The men had six runners under 26:00, but the top five average was 25:05, the fastest this season. The men are looking strong with plenty of depth, something that will be a great strength when we race ten men for conference in three weeks.
					</p>
					<h2 class="meet_name">Cascade Conference Championship</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Results TBD</strong><br>This meet will be huge. We have great competition in our conference with College of Idaho and Eastern Oregon. All three of us are in the top 11 nationally.
					</p>
					<h2 class="meet_name">NAIA National Championship</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Results TBD</strong><br>This will be the last chance many men on our team will have to show what they got. We are looking for a podium finish and with the right day, it is in reach.
